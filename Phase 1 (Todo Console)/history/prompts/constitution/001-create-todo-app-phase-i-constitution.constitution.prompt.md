## Prompt

```text
 # Phase I: Todo In-Memory Python Console App - Constitution

## Project Overview
A command-line todo application that stores tasks in memory, built using spec-driven development with Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.

## Core Principles

### 1. Spec-Driven Development (Non-Negotiable)
* **NO manual code writing** - All code must be generated by Claude Code
* Constitution and specifications must be written FIRST, before any implementation
* Refine specs until Claude Code generates correct output
* All specifications stored in `/specs` folder with version history

### 2. Project Architecture
**Technology Stack:**
* Python 3.13+
* UV (package manager)
* Claude Code (AI coding assistant)
* Spec-Kit Plus (specification management)

**Project Structure:**
```

```

### 3. Feature Requirements (Basic Level)
All 5 Basic Level features are **mandatory** for Phase I:

1. **Add Task** - Create new todo items with title and description
2. **Delete Task** - Remove tasks from the list by ID
3. **Update Task** - Modify existing task details (title, description)
4. **View Task List** - Display all tasks with status indicators
5. **Mark as Complete** - Toggle task completion status

### 4. Domain Rules (Enforced by todo-domain-agent)

**Task Definition:**
* Task must have: unique ID, title (required), description (optional), completion status
* Title: 1-200 characters (required)
* Description: max 1000 characters (optional)
* Status: boolean (complete/incomplete)
* Created timestamp: auto-generated
* Updated timestamp: auto-updated on changes

**Allowed Operations:**
* Add: Create task with title (required) and description (optional)
* List: View all tasks with ID, title, status
* Update: Modify title and/or description of existing task
* Complete: Toggle completion status (true/false)
* Delete: Remove task permanently by ID

**Edge Cases to Handle:**
* Empty task title → Reject with error message
* Duplicate task titles → Allow (users may want similar tasks)
* Invalid task ID → Return "Task not found" error
* Update non-existent task → Return error
* Delete non-existent task → Return error
* Empty task list → Display "No tasks found" message

### 5. Code Quality Standards (Enforced by python-cli-agent)

**Python Patterns:**
* Clean, beginner-friendly code
* Type hints throughout
* Docstrings for all functions and classes
* Error handling for all user inputs
* No external dependencies beyond standard library (for Phase I)

**CLI Best Practices:**
* Clear menu system with numbered options
* Input validation with helpful error messages
* Confirmation prompts for destructive actions (delete)
* Clean input/output flows
* Graceful exit handling

**Code Organization:**
* Separation of concerns: Task model, TaskManager, CLI interface
* Single Responsibility Principle
* DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
* Proper encapsulation

### 6. User Experience Requirements

**Menu Interface:**
```
=== Todo App ===
1. Add Task
2. View All Tasks
3. Update Task
4. Mark Task Complete
5. Delete Task
6. Exit

Enter your choice (1-6):
```

**Task Display Format:**
```
ID: 1 | [X] Buy groceries | Created: 2025-01-15 10:30
    Description: Milk, eggs, bread

ID: 2 | [ ] Call dentist | Created: 2025-01-15 11:45
    Description: Schedule annual checkup
```

**User Interactions:**
* Clear prompts for all inputs
* Immediate feedback on actions ("Task added successfully!")
* Error messages that explain what went wrong
* Ability to cancel operations
* No crashes - graceful error handling

### 7. Validation Criteria (Enforced by hackathon-review-agent)

**Phase Appropriateness:**
* In-memory storage ONLY (no files, no database)
* Console application (no GUI, no web)
* Single-user (no authentication)
* Basic features only (no priorities, tags, or advanced features)

**Simplicity Checklist:**
* Can be explained in 2 minutes? ✓
* Can be demoed in 90 seconds? ✓
* No over-engineering (YAGNI principle)
* Clear, readable code that a beginner can understand
* Minimal but complete feature set

**Demo Readiness:**
* All 5 basic features work without errors
* Clean, professional console output
* Runs smoothly on first try
* Easy setup (just Python + UV)

### 8. Development Workflow

**Spec-First Process:**
1. Write feature specification in `/specs/features/`
2. Define acceptance criteria in spec
3. Use Claude Code to generate implementation
4. Test against acceptance criteria
5. Refine spec if needed, regenerate code
6. Repeat until feature meets criteria

**Iteration Cycle:**
```
Write Spec → Generate Code → Test → Refine Spec → Regenerate → Test → Done
```

**Never:**
* Write code manually (use Claude Code)
* Skip specification documentation
* Implement features not in specs
* Over-engineer for future phases

### 9. Testing Requirements

**Manual Testing Checklist:**
* [ ] Add task with title only
* [ ] Add task with title and description
* [ ] View empty task list
* [ ] View populated task list
* [ ] Update task title
* [ ] Update task description
* [ ] Mark task complete
* [ ] Mark task incomplete
* [ ] Delete existing task
* [ ] Handle invalid task ID
* [ ] Handle empty title input
* [ ] Handle menu navigation
* [ ] Exit application cleanly

**Error Handling:**
* All user inputs validated
* Helpful error messages
* No application crashes
* Graceful degradation

## Amendment Process

This constitution can only be amended through documented process with version control and ratification.
```

## Response snapshot

Constitution created successfully at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with the following characteristics:

**Version**: 1.0.0 (MAJOR - initial establishment)
**Ratified**: 2025-12-27
**Last Amended**: 2025-12-27

**Structure Created:**
- 13 Core Principles with detailed enforcement rules
- Development Workflow section with quality gates
- Testing Requirements section with test categories
- Amendment Process with semantic versioning rules
- Governance section with enforcement mechanisms

**Key Decisions:**
1. **Spec-Driven Development**: Made NON-NEGOTIABLE - all code must be AI-generated
2. **Technology Stack**: Fixed to Python 3.13+, UV, Standard Library only
3. **Scope**: Limited to 5 Basic Level features (CRUD + Complete)
4. **Domain Rules**: Comprehensive edge case handling defined
5. **Agent Roles**: Mapped 4 specialized agents to specific principles

**Template Alignment:**
- ✅ plan-template.md: Constitution Check section aligns with 13 principles
- ✅ spec-template.md: User scenarios and requirements align with domain rules
- ✅ tasks-template.md: Task structure aligns with workflow and testing

**Sync Impact Report** (embedded in constitution as HTML comment):
- Initial version establishment (no previous version)
- All 13 principles added
- 3 additional sections added (Development Workflow, Testing, Amendment Process)
- Templates reviewed and confirmed compatible

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Constitution established as governance foundation for Todo App Phase I; all future specifications and implementations must comply with 13 core principles
- 🧪 Tests: Manual validation performed against principle completeness, template alignment, and versioning correctness
- 📁 Files: 1 file created - `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (466 lines, comprehensive)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Create feature specifications using `/sp.specify todo-app`, then architectural plan with `/sp.plan`, followed by task breakdown with `/sp.tasks`
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution successfully captures all user requirements with precise domain rules, clear constraints, and enforceable standards; ready for spec-driven development workflow

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - constitution creation succeeded on first attempt with complete coverage
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL):
  - Template alignment check: PASS (3/3 templates compatible)
  - Placeholder resolution: PASS (all placeholders replaced)
  - Versioning correctness: PASS (semantic version 1.0.0 with rationale)
  - Principle completeness: PASS (13 principles cover all user requirements)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A (initial constitution)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Test constitution enforcement by attempting to create a feature specification without required domain rules to verify agent compliance
